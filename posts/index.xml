      <description>Description On some of our CentOS Linux nodes, we use Zabbix to monitor host resources. Sometimes, Zabbix reports system swap space high usage when the used size is larger then 50% of its total space, which indicates there may not be sufficient RAM. After cleaning up some unused tasks, available memory reaches up to 90GB+ according to the result of free -h command while the total swap space is only 10GB.</description>

      <description>Reference https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray/blob/master/docs/kubernetes-reliability.md
Overview Distributed system such as Kubernetes are designed to be resilient to the failures. More details about Kubernetes High-Availability (HA) may be found at Building High-Availability Clusters
To have a simple view the most of parts of HA will be skipped to describe Kubelet&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Controller Manager communication only.
By default the normal behavior looks like:
 Kubelet updates it status to apiserver periodically, as specified by --node-status-update-frequency. The default value is 10s.</description>

      <description>Kata Container  Full Kernel Lets system calls go through freely Performance penalty due to the VM layer. Not clear yet how slower or faster than gVisor On paper, slower startup time. Can run in nested virtualized environments if the hypervisor and hardware support it.  gVisor  Partial Kernel Intercepts syscalls Performance penalty at runtime due to syscall filtering. Not clear how slower or faster than Kata yet. On paper, faster startup time.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hexo is an alternative of jekyll to create static blog pages from markdown on Github Pages. Implemented with nodejs, Hexo is quite easy to use compared with jekyll. Using Hexo and a theme named &amp;ldquo;NexT&amp;rdquo;, I am here now to demonstrate how to create a pretty nice blog site on Github Pages within just a few minutes.
Prerequisites To begin with, you&amp;rsquo;ll need: * node * git * a github account</description>
